          Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and
          physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical
          experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
          Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the
          United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a
          short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he
          struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market
          his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to
          develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating
          current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents,
          licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable
          amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system
          which that company eventually marketed. Attempting to develop
          inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of
          experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical
          discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly
          controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well
          known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities
          and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at
          public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for
          wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution
          in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and
          Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility
          of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these
          ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project,
          an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but
          ran out of funding before he could complete it. After Wardenclyffe,
          Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s
          with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla
          lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He
          died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla obtained around 300
          patents worldwide for his inventions.

          Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some
          of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have
          discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a
          minimum of 278 known patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of
          Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but
          many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many
          inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.
          Contemporary biographers call Tesla "the man who invented the XX
          century" and the "holy intercessor" of modern electricity. After
          demonstrating the radio and winning the "War of Currents", Tesla
          received widespread recognition as an outstanding electrical engineer
          and inventor. Tesla's early work paved the way for modern electrical
          engineering, and his discoveries of the early period had innovative
          significance. In the USA, Tesla's fame could compete with any inventor
          or scientist in history, as well as in popular culture.

            <strong><span> Wireless lighting.</span></strong> After 1890, Tesla
            experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive
            coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He
            attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field
            inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public
            demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent
            light bulbs from across a stage. He spent most of the decade working
            on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various
            investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial
            product out of his findings. In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the
            Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National
            Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a
            system like his could eventually conduct "intelligible signals or
            perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires" by
            conducting it through the Earth. Tesla served as a vice-president of
            the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894,
            the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of
            Radio Engineers).

            <strong><span>Wireless power.</span></strong>
            From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time
            and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the
            transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion
            of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been
            demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to
            transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had
            pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide
            communications. At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there
            was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals
            over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had
            studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part
            of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect. Also, this
            new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a
            short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a
            mile. Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true,
            they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this
            form of "invisible light" would diminish over a distance just like
            any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out
            into space, becoming "hopelessly lost". By the mid-1890s, Tesla was
            working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity
            long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working
            on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large
            resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston
            Street lab. Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that
            the Earth's atmosphere was conductive, he proposed a system composed
            of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in
            the air above 30,000 feet (9,100 m) in altitude, where he thought
            the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions
            of volts) long distances.

            <strong><span>X-ray experimentation.</span></strong> Starting in
            1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant
            energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his
            laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as "Roentgen
            rays" or "X-rays"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a
            cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently
            captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's
            December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried
            to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier
            type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was
            the metal locking screw on the camera lens. In March 1896, after
            hearing of Röntgen's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging
            (radiography), Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray
            imaging, developing a high-energy single-terminal vacuum tube of his
            own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the
            output of the Tesla coil (the modern term for the phenomenon
            produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In
            his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce
            X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument will ...
            enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than
            obtainable with ordinary apparatus". Tesla noted the hazards of
            working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In
            his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he
            attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on
            that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by
            the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser
            extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were
            longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas.
            These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.
